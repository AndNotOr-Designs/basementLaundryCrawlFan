# purpose
    - create a fan to bring in cool air from crawl space under laundry

# hardware
    - DoIt ESP32 Devkit V1 (www.doit.am)
    - half+ breadboard (with no power rail sides)
    - Relay module

# notes
    - had issues with ESP32-CAM which I really wanted to use, but it never stayed online 
        so I switched to the DoIt V1 module.
